If a client makes an HTTP request to the server that returns a non-specific error message, this is typically an issue with the **opscode-chef** or **opscode-erchef** services. View the full error message for these services in their respective log files. The error is most often a stacktrace from the application error. In some cases, the error message will clearly indicate a problem with another service, which can then be investigated further. For non-obvious errors, please contact Chef support services.
