A service that is enabled and running:

.. code-block:: ruby

   control_group 'audit name' do
     control 'mysql service' do
       let(:mysql_service) { service('mysql') }
       it 'should be enabled' do
         expect(mysql_service).to be_enabled
       end
       it 'should be running' do
         expect(mysql_service).to be_running
       end
     end
   end

If the audit was successful, the chef-client will return output similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   Audit Mode
     mysql service audit
       mysql service
         is enabled
         is running
