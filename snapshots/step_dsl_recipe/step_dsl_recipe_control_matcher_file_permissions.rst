.. The contents of this file may be included in multiple topics (using the includes directive).
.. The contents of this file should be modified in a way that preserves its ability to appear in multiple topics.

The following example shows how to verify that a file has the desired permissions and contents:

.. code-block:: ruby

   controls 'mysql config' do
     control 'mysql config file' do
       let(:config_file) { file('/etc/mysql/my.cnf') }
       it 'exists with correct permissions' do
         expect(config_file).to be_file
         expect(config_file).to be_mode(0400)
       end
       it 'contains required configuration' do
         expect(its('contents')).to match(/default-time-zone='UTC'/)
       end
     end
   end

If the audit was successful, the chef-client will return output similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   Audit Mode
     mysql config
       mysql config file
         exists with correct permissions
         contains required configuration
