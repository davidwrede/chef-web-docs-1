The ``attr_accessor`` method is used to define custom properties for a lightweight resource that can be accessed by a lightweight provider. The syntax for the ``attr_accessor`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   attr_accessor :accessor_name, :accessor_name

where ``accessor_name`` is a comma-delimited list of custom properties.
