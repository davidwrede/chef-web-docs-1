Chef provisioning is a collection of resources that enable the creation of machines and machine infrastructures using the chef-client. It has a plugin model that allows bootstrap operations to be done against any infrastructure, such as VirtualBox, DigitalOcean, Amazon EC2, LXC, bare metal, and more.

Chef provisioning is built around two major components: the **machine** resource and drivers.
