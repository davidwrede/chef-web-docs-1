Cookbooks that contain custom resources in the ``/libraries`` directory of a cookbook should:

* Be inspected for instances of a) the ``Chef::Provider`` base class, and then b) for the presence of any core resources from the chef-client
* Be updated to use the ``LWRPBase`` base class

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Chef
     class Provider
       class LvmLogicalVolume < Chef::Provider::LWRPBase
         include Chef::Mixin::ShellOut

         ...
         if new_resource.mount_point
           if new_resource.mount_point.is_a?(String)
             mount_spec = { :location => new_resource.mount_point }
           else
             mount_spec = new_resource.mount_point
           end

           dir_resource = directory mount_spec[:location] do
             mode 0755
             owner 'root'
             group 'root'
             recursive true
             action :nothing
             not_if { Pathname.new(mount_spec[:location]).mountpoint? }
           end
           dir_resource.run_action(:create)
           updates << dir_resource.updated?

           mount_resource = mount mount_spec[:location] do
             options mount_spec[:options]
             dump mount_spec[:dump]
             pass mount_spec[:pass]
             device device_name
             fstype fs_type
             action :nothing
           end
           mount_resource.run_action(:mount)
           mount_resource.run_action(:enable)
           updates << mount_resource.updated?
         end
         new_resource.updated_by_last_action(updates.any?)
       end
