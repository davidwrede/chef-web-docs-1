The Delivery CLI is required for the workstation and for many Chef Automate functions. It is included in the Chef DK and can be obtained by `installing the latest version <https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html>`_.

.. note:: You must delete your old Delivery CLI if you installed it prior to it being included in the Chef DK.
