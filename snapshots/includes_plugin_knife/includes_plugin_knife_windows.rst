The ``knife windows`` subcommand is used to configure and interact with nodes that exist on server and/or desktop machines that are running Microsoft Windows. Nodes are configured using WinRM, which allows native objects---batch scripts, Windows PowerShell scripts, or scripting library variables---to be called by external applications. The ``knife windows`` subcommand supports NTLM and Kerberos methods of authentication.
