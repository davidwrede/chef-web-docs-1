A knife plugin is a set of one (or more) subcommands that can be added to knife to support additional functionality that is not built-in to the base set of knife subcommands. Many of the knife plugins are built by members of the Chef community and several of them are built and maintained by Chef. A knife plugin is installed to the ``~/.chef/plugins/knife/`` directory, from where it can be run just like any other knife subcommand.
