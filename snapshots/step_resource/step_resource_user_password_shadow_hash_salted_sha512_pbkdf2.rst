Mac OS X 10.8 (and higher) calculates the password shadow hash using SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2. The length of the shadow hash value is 128 bytes, the salt value is 32 bytes, and an integer specifies the number of iterations. The following code will calculate password shadow hashes for Mac OS X 10.8 (and higher):

.. code-block:: ruby

   password = 'my_awesome_password'
   salt = OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(32)
   iterations = 25000 # Any value above 20k should be fine.
   
   shadow_hash = OpenSSL::PKCS5::pbkdf2_hmac(
     password,
     salt,
     iterations,
     128,
     OpenSSL::Digest::SHA512.new
   ).unpack('H*').first
   salt_value = salt.unpack('H*').first

Use the calculated password shadow hash with the **user** resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   user 'my_awesome_user' do
     password 'cbd1a....fc843'  # Length: 256
     salt 'bd1a....fc83'        # Length: 64
     iterations 25000
   end
