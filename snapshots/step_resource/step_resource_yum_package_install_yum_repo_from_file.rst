The following example shows how to install new Yum repositories from a file, where the installation of the repository triggers a creation of the Yum cache that forces the internal cache for the chef-client to reload:

.. code-block:: ruby

   execute 'create-yum-cache' do
    command 'yum -q makecache'
    action :nothing
   end
   
   ruby_block 'reload-internal-yum-cache' do
     block do
       Chef::Provider::Package::Yum::YumCache.instance.reload
     end
     action :nothing
   end
   
   cookbook_file '/etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo' do
     source 'custom'
     mode '0755'
     notifies :run, 'execute[create-yum-cache]', :immediately
     notifies :create, 'ruby_block[reload-internal-yum-cache]', :immediately
   end
