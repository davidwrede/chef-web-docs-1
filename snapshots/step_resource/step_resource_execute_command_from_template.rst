The following example shows how to set up IPv4 packet forwarding using the **execute** resource to run a command named ``forward_ipv4`` that uses a template defined by the **template** resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   execute 'forward_ipv4' do
     command 'echo > /proc/.../ipv4/ip_forward'
     action :nothing
   end
   
   template '/etc/file_name.conf' do
     source 'routing/file_name.conf.erb'
     notifies :run, 'execute[forward_ipv4]', :delayed
   end

where the ``command`` property for the **execute** resource contains the command that is to be run and the ``source`` property for the **template** resource specifies which template to use. The ``notifies`` property for the **template** specifies that the ``execute[forward_ipv4]`` (which is defined by the **execute** resource) should be queued up and run at the end of the chef-client run.
