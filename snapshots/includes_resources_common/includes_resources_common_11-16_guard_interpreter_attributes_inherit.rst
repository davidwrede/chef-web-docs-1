The ``guard_interpreter`` property is set to ``:default`` by default. When the ``guard_interpreter`` property is set to ``:default``, the ``not_if`` or ``only_if`` properties will guard statements that **do not inherit** properties that are defined by the **script**-based resource in which the ``not_if`` or ``only_if`` guard statement is defined.

For example, the ``not_if`` guard statement in the following example **does not inherit** the ``environment`` property:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bash 'javatooling' do
     environment 'JAVA_HOME' => '/usr/lib/java/jdk1.7/home'
     code 'java-based-daemon-ctl.sh -start'
     not_if 'java-based-daemon-ctl.sh -test-started'
   end

and requires adding the ``environment`` property to the ``not_if`` guard statement so that it may use the ``JAVA_HOME`` path as part of its evaluation:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bash 'javatooling' do
     environment 'JAVA_HOME' => '/usr/lib/java/jdk1.7/home'
     code 'java-based-daemon-ctl.sh -start'
     not_if 'java-based-daemon-ctl.sh -test-started', :environment => 'JAVA_HOME' => '/usr/lib/java/jdk1.7/home'
   end

To inherit properties, add the ``guard_interpreter`` property to the resource block and set it to the appropriate value:

* ``:bash`` for **bash**
* ``:batch`` for **batch**
* ``:csh`` for **csh**
* ``:perl`` for **perl**
* ``:powershell_script`` for **powershell_script**
* ``:python`` for **python**
* ``:ruby`` for **ruby**

For example, using the same example as from above, but this time adding the ``guard_interpreter`` property and setting it to ``:bash``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bash 'javatooling' do
     guard_interpreter :bash
     environment 'JAVA_HOME' => '/usr/lib/java/jdk1.7/home'
     code 'java-based-daemon-ctl.sh -start'
     not_if 'java-based-daemon-ctl.sh -test-started'
   end

The ``not_if`` statement now inherits the ``environment`` property and will use the ``JAVA_HOME`` path as part of its evaluation.
