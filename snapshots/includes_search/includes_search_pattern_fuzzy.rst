A fuzzy matching search pattern is used to search based on the proximity of two strings of characters. An (optional) integer may be used as part of the search query to more closely define the proximity. A fuzzy matching search pattern has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

   "search_query"~edit_distance

where ``search_query`` is the string that will be used during the search and ``edit_distance`` is the proximity. A tilde ("~") is used to separate the edit distance from the search query.
