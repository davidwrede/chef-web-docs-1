A search query is comprised of two parts: the key and the search pattern. A search query has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

   key:search_pattern

where ``key`` is a field name that is found in the JSON description of an indexable object on the Chef server (a role, node, client, environment, or data bag) and ``search_pattern`` defines what will be searched for, using one of the following search patterns: exact, wildcard, range, or fuzzy matching. Both ``key`` and ``search_pattern`` are case-sensitive; ``key`` has limited support for multiple character wildcard matching using an asterisk ("*") (and as long as it is not the first character).
