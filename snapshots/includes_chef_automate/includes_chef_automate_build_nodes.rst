.. note:: Legacy build nodes created by ``delivery-cluster`` can be used with a Chef Automate server.  Some visibility features are designed to only work with new build nodes installed through the command line process, but the workflow feature in Chef Automate can use legacy, new, or mixed build node pools; however, you cannot upgrade a legacy build node to the new build node model.  If you would like new build nodes, please use fresh hosts or completely wipe your legacy build nodes before attempting to run ``delivery-ctl install-build-node``.
