The ORGANIZATION-validator.pem is typically added to the .chef directory on the workstation. When a node is bootstrapped from that workstation, the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem is used to authenticate the newly-created node to the Chef server during the initial chef-client run. Starting with chef-client version 12.1, it is possible to bootstrap a node using the USER.pem file instead of the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file. This is known as a "validatorless bootstrap".

To create a node via the USER.pem file, simply delete the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file on the workstation. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rm -f /home/lamont/.chef/myorg-validator.pem

and then make the following changes in the knife.rb file:

* Remove the ``validation_client_name`` setting
* Edit the ``validation_key`` setting to be something that isn't a path to an existent ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file. For example: ``/nonexist``.

As long as a USER.pem is also present on the workstation from which the validatorless bootstrap operation will be initiated, the bootstrap operation will run and will use the USER.pem file instead of the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file.

When running a validatorless ``knife bootstrap`` operation, the output is similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   desktop% knife bootstrap 10.1.1.1 -N foo01.acme.org \
     -E dev -r 'role[base]' -j '{ "foo": "bar" }' \
     --ssh-user vagrant --sudo
   Node foo01.acme.org exists, overwrite it? (Y/N)
   Client foo01.acme.org exists, overwrite it? (Y/N)
   Creating new client for foo01.acme.org
   Creating new node for foo01.acme.org
   Connecting to 10.1.1.1
   10.1.1.1 Starting first Chef Client run...
   [....etc...]
