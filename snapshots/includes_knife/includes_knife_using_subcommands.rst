knife comes with a collection of built in subcommands that work together to provide all of the functionality required to take specific actions against any object in an organization, including cookbooks, nodes, roles, data bags, environments, and users. A knife plugin extends the functionality beyond built-in subcommands.

knife has the following subcommands: ``bootstrap``, ``client``, ``configure``, ``cookbook``, ``cookbook site``, ``data bag``, ``delete``, ``deps``, ``diff``, ``download``, ``edit``, ``environment``, ``exec``, ``index rebuild``, ``list``, ``node``, ``recipe list``, ``role``, ``search``, ``show``, ``ssh``, ``status``, ``tag``, ``upload``, ``user``, and ``xargs``.

.. note:: The following subcommands run only against the open source Chef server: ``index rebuild`` and ``user``.
