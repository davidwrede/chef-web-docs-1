This subcommand has the following options:

``-A``, ``--forward-agent``
   Enable SSH agent forwarding.

``--bootstrap-curl-options OPTIONS``
   Arbitrary options to be added to the bootstrap command when using cURL. This option may not be used in the same command with ``--bootstrap-install-command``.

``--bootstrap-install-command COMMAND``
   Execute a custom installation command sequence for the chef-client. This option may not be used in the same command with ``--bootstrap-curl-options``, ``--bootstrap-install-sh``, or ``--bootstrap-wget-options``.

``--bootstrap-install-sh URL``
   Fetch and execute an installation script at the specified URL. This option may not be used in the same command with ``--bootstrap-install-command``.

``--bootstrap-no-proxy NO_PROXY_URL_or_IP``
   A URL or IP address that specifies a location that should not be proxied.

   .. note:: This option is used internally by Chef to help verify bootstrap operations during testing and should never be used during an actual bootstrap operation.

``--bootstrap-proxy PROXY_URL``
   The proxy server for the node that is the target of a bootstrap operation.

``--bootstrap-vault-file VAULT_FILE``
   The path to a JSON file that contains a list of vaults and items to be updated.

``--bootstrap-vault-item VAULT_ITEM``
   A single vault and item to update as ``vault:item``.

``--bootstrap-vault-json VAULT_JSON``
   A JSON string that contains a list of vaults and items to be updated.

   .. include:: ../../step_knife/step_knife_bootstrap_vault_json.rst

``--bootstrap-version VERSION``
   The version of the chef-client to install.

``--bootstrap-wget-options OPTIONS``
   Arbitrary options to be added to the bootstrap command when using GNU Wget. This option may not be used in the same command with ``--bootstrap-install-command``.

``-E ENVIRONMENT``, ``--environment ENVIRONMENT``
   The name of the environment. When this option is added to a command, the command will run only against the named environment.

``-G GATEWAY``, ``--ssh-gateway GATEWAY``
   The SSH tunnel or gateway that is used to run a bootstrap action on a machine that is not accessible from the workstation.

``--hint HINT_NAME[=HINT_FILE]``
   An Ohai hint to be set on the target node.

   .. include:: ../../includes_ohai/includes_ohai_hints.rst

   .. include:: ../../includes_ohai/includes_ohai_hints_json.rst

   ``HINT_FILE`` is the name of the JSON file. ``HINT_NAME`` is the name of a hint in a JSON file. Use multiple ``--hint`` options to specify multiple hints.

``-i IDENTITY_FILE``, ``--ssh-identity-file IDENTITY_FILE``
   The SSH identity file used for authentication. Key-based authentication is recommended.

``-j JSON_ATTRIBS``, ``--json-attributes JSON_ATTRIBS``
   A JSON string that is added to the first run of a chef-client.

``-N NAME``, ``--node-name NAME``
   The name of the node.

   .. note:: This option is required for a validatorless bootstrap (as of chef-client version 12.4).

``--[no-]host-key-verify``
   Use ``--no-host-key-verify`` to disable host key verification. Default setting: ``--host-key-verify``.

``--[no-]node-verify-api-cert``
   Verify the SSL certificate on the Chef server. When ``true``, the chef-client always verifies the SSL certificate. When ``false``, the chef-client uses the value of ``ssl_verify_mode`` to determine if the SSL certificate requires verification. If this option is not specified, the setting for ``verify_api_cert`` in the configuration file is applied.

``--node-ssl-verify-mode PEER_OR_NONE``
   Set the verify mode for HTTPS requests.

   Use ``none`` to do no validation of SSL certificates.

   Use ``peer`` to do validation of all SSL certificates, including the Chef server connections, S3 connections, and any HTTPS **remote_file** resource URLs used in the chef-client run. This is the recommended setting.

``-p PORT``, ``--ssh-port PORT``
   The SSH port.

``-P PASSWORD``, ``--ssh-password PASSWORD``
   The SSH password. This can be used to pass the password directly on the command line. If this option is not specified (and a password is required) knife prompts for the password.

``--prerelease``
   Install pre-release gems.

``-r RUN_LIST``, ``--run-list RUN_LIST``
   A comma-separated list of roles and/or recipes to be applied.

``--secret SECRET``
   The encryption key that is used for values contained within a data bag item.

``--secret-file FILE``
   The path to the file that contains the encryption key.

``--sudo``
   Execute a bootstrap operation with sudo.

``--sudo-preserve-home``
   Use to preserve the non-root user's ``HOME`` environment.

``-t TEMPLATE``, ``--bootstrap-template TEMPLATE``
   The bootstrap template to use. This may be the name of a bootstrap template---``chef-full``, for example---or it may be the full path to an Embedded Ruby (ERB) template that defines a custom bootstrap. Default value: ``chef-full``, which installs the chef-client using the omnibus installer on all supported platforms.

``--use-sudo-password``
   Perform a bootstrap operation with sudo; specify the password with the ``-P`` (or ``--ssh-password``) option.

``-V -V``
   Run the initial chef-client run at the ``debug`` log-level (e.g. ``chef-client -l debug``).

``-x USERNAME``, ``--ssh-user USERNAME``
   The SSH user name.
