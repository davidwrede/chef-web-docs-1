This subcommand has the following options:

``--chef-repo-path PATH``
   The path to the chef-repo. This setting will override the default path to the chef-repo. Default: same value as specified by ``chef_repo_path`` in client.rb.

``--concurrency``
   The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: ``10``.

``--local``
   Show files in the local chef-repo instead of a remote location. Default: ``false``.

``--repo-mode MODE``
   The layout of the local chef-repo. Possible values: ``static``, ``everything``, or ``hosted_everything``. Use ``static`` for just roles, environments, cookbooks, and data bags. By default, ``everything`` and ``hosted_everything`` are dynamically selected depending on the server type. Default: ``everything`` / ``hosted_everything``.
