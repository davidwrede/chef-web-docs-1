Most data is entered using a text editor in JSON format, unless the ``--disable-editing`` option is entered as part of a command. (Encrypted data bags use YAML, which is a superset of JSON.) JSON is a common, language-independent data format that provides a simple text representation of arbitrary data structures. For more information about JSON, see http://www.json.org/ or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON.
