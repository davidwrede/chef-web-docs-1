Use the ``share`` argument to add a cookbook to |url community_cookbooks|. This action will require a user account and a certificate for |url community|. By default, knife will use the user name and API key that is identified in the configuration file used during the upload; otherwise these values must be specified on the command line or in an alternate configuration file. If a cookbook already exists on |url community_cookbooks|, then only an owner or maintainer of that cookbook can make updates.
