The Chef server uses organizations, groups, and users to define role-based access control:

     - An organization is the top-level entity for role-based access control in the Chef server. Each organization contains the default groups (``admins``, ``clients``, and ``users``, plus ``billing_admins`` for the hosted Chef server), at least one user and at least one node (on which the chef-client is installed). The Chef server supports multiple organizations. The Chef server includes a single default organization that is defined during setup. Additional organizations can be created after the initial setup and configuration of the Chef server.

     - A user is any non-administrator human being who will manage data that is uploaded to the Chef server from a workstation or who will log on to the Chef management console web user interface. The Chef server includes a single default user that is defined during setup and is automatically assigned to the ``admins`` group.
