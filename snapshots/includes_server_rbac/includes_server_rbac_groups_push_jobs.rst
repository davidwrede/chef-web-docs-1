It is possible to initiate jobs from the chef-client, such as from within a recipe based on an action to be determined as the recipe runs. For a chef-client to be able to create, initiate, or read jobs, the chef-client on which Chef push jobs is configured must belong to one (or both) of the following groups:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Group
     - Description
   * - ``pushy_job_readers``
     - Use to view the status of jobs.
   * - ``pushy_job_writers``
     - Use to create and initiate jobs.

These groups do not exist by default, even after Chef push jobs has been installed to the Chef server. If these groups are not created, only members of the ``admin`` security group will be able to create, initiate, and view jobs.
