The hosted Chef server is a version of the Chef server that is hosted by Chef. The hosted Chef server is cloud-based, scalable, and available (24x7/365), with resource-based access control. The hosted Chef server has the same automation capabilities of any Chef server, but without requiring it to be set up and managed from behind the firewall.
