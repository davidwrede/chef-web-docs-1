You can switch between organizations in a similar manner to the Chef Analytics to see actions for a particular organization.

To switch organizations:

#. Open Chef Analytics.
#. Next to **Organization**, choose the new organization from the drop-down.

#. A newly-created or newly-associated organization may not appear in the drop-down list. If this occurs, log out of Chef Analytics, and then log back in. This will refresh the list of organizations.
