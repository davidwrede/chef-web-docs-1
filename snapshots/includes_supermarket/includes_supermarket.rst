Chef Supermarket is the site for community cookbooks. It provides an easily searchable cookbook repository and a friendly web UI. Cookbooks that are part of the Chef Supermarket are accessible by any Chef user.

There are two ways to use Chef Supermarket:

* The public Chef Supermarket is hosted by Chef and is located at |url supermarket|. Contributing to cookbooks on Chef Supermarket :doc:`requires signing a license </community_contributions>`.
* A private Chef Supermarket may be installed on-premise behind the firewall on the internal network. Cookbook retrieval from a private Chef Supermarket is often faster than from the public Chef Supermarket because of closer proximity and fewer cookbooks to resolve. A private cookbook can also help formalize internal cookbook release management processes (e.g. "a cookbook is not released until it's published on Chef Supermarket").
