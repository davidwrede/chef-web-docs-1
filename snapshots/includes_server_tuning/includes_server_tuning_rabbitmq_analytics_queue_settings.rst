``rabbitmq['drop_on_full_capacity']``
   Specify if messages will stop being sent to the RabbitMQ queue when it is at capacity. Default value: ``true``.

``rabbitmq['management_user']``
   The rabbitmq-management plugin user. Default value: ``'rabbitmgmt'``.

``rabbitmq['prevent_erchef_startup_on_full_capacity']``
   Specify if the Chef server will start when the monitored RabbitMQ queue is full. Default value: ``false``.

``rabbitmq['queue_at_capacity_affects_overall_status']``
   Specify if the ``_status`` endpoint in the Chef server API will fail if the monitored queue is at capacity. Default value: ``false``.

``rabbitmq['queue_length_monitor_enabled']``
   Specify if the queue length monitor is enabled. Default value: ``true``.

``rabbitmq['queue_length_monitor_millis']``
   The frequency (in milliseconds) at which the length of the RabbitMQ queue is checked. Default value: ``30000``.

``rabbitmq['queue_length_monitor_timeout_millis']``
   The timeout (in milliseconds) at which calls to the queue length monitor will stop if the Chef server is overloaded. Default value: ``5000``.

``rabbitmq['queue_length_monitor_queue']``
   The RabbitMQ queue that is observed by queue length monitor. Default value: ``'alaska'``.
