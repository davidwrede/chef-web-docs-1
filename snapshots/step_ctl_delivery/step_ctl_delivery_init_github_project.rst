To initialize a project using a GitHub repository, run a command similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery init --github ORG_NAME -r REPO_NAME

where ``ORG_NAME`` is the name of the GitHub organization and ``REPO_NAME`` is the name of the repository in GitHub. For example to initialize the ``seapower`` repository in GitHub with the ``chef-cookbooks`` organization:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery init --github chef-cookbooks -r seapower

and returns output similar to:

.. code-block:: bash
