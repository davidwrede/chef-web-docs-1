The behavior of pipeline phases can be customized using the project's ``config.json`` file. Each ``config.json`` file has a set of required settings as well as optional settings that can be set, such as which build nodes to use for specific phases, whether to skip certain phases, and so on. The basic settings are defined below; however, additional settings, such as which linting rules to follow, can also be added. See the `delivery-truck readme <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck/blob/master/README.md>`_ for examples on how to add custom settings.
