A cookbook version always takes the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z are decimal numbers that are used to represent major (x), minor (y), and patch (z) versions. A two-part version (x.y) is also allowed. Alphanumeric version numbers (1.2.a3) and version numbers with more than three parts (1.2.3.4) are not allowed.
