A "custom resource" is the new way to refer to any style of custom resources, including lightweight resources (LWRPs), heavyweight resources (HWRPs), definitions, or any other implementation of a custom resource. This change was made in the chef-client 12.5 release, but applied retroactively. A new and improved approach for building custom resources was added in chef-client 12.5 and the term "custom resource" now refers to any method of building a custom resource for releases of Chef prior to 12.5, and then only the new method starting with 12.5.
