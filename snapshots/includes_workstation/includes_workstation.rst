A workstation is a computer that is configured to run various Chef command-line tools that synchronize with a chef-repo, author cookbooks, interact with the Chef server, and interact with nodes.

The workstation is the location from which most users do most of their work, including:

* Developing cookbooks and recipes (and authoring them using Ruby syntax and patterns)
* Keeping the chef-repo synchronized with version source control
* Using command-line tools
* Configuring organizational policy, including defining roles and environments and ensuring that critical data is stored in data bags
* Interacting with nodes, as (or when) required, such as performing a bootstrap operation
