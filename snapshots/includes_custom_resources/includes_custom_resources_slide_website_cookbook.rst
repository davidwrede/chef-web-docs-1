This article assumes that a cookbook directory named ``website`` exists in a chef-repo with (at least) the following directories:

.. code-block:: text

   /website
     /recipes
     /resources
     /templates

You may use a cookbook that already exists or you may create a new cookbook.

See https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html for more information about how to use the ``chef`` command-line tool that is packaged with the Chef development kit to build the chef-repo, plus related cookbook sub-directories.
