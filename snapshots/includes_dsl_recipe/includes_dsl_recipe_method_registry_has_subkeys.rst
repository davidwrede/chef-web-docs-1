Use the ``registry_has_subkeys?`` method to find out if a Microsoft Windows registry key has one (or more) values. 

.. note:: .. include:: ../../includes_notes/includes_notes_registry_key_not_if_only_if.rst

The syntax for the ``registry_has_subkeys?`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_has_subkeys?(KEY_PATH, ARCHITECTURE)

where:

* ``KEY_PATH`` is the path to the registry key. The path must include the registry hive, which can be specified either as its full name or as the 3- or 4-letter abbreviation. For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.
* ``ARCHITECTURE`` is one of the following values: ``:x86_64``, ``:i386``, or ``:machine``. In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines running Microsoft Windows, the ``architecture`` property must be set to ``:i386``. The ``:x86_64`` value can be used to force writing to a 64-bit registry location, but this value is less useful than the default (``:machine``) because the chef-client returns an exception if ``:x86_64`` is used and the machine turns out to be a 32-bit machine (whereas with ``:machine``, the chef-client is able to access the registry key on the 32-bit machine).

This method will return ``true`` or ``false``.
