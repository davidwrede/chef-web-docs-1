Use ``:filter_result`` as part of a search query to filter the search output based on the pattern specified by a Hash. Only attributes in the Hash will be returned.

.. note:: .. include:: ../../includes_notes/includes_notes_filter_search_vs_partial_search.rst

The syntax for the ``search`` method that uses ``:filter_result`` is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   search(:index, 'query',
     :filter_result => { 'foo' => [ 'abc' ],
                         'bar' => [ '123' ],
                         'baz' => [ 'sea', 'power' ]
                       }
         ).each do |result|
     puts result['foo']
     puts result['bar']
     puts result['baz']
   end

where:

* ``:index`` is of name of the index on the Chef server against which the search query will run: ``:client``, ``:data_bag_name``, ``:environment``, ``:node``, and ``:role``
* ``'query'`` is a valid search query against an object on the Chef server
* ``:filter_result`` defines a Hash of values to be returned

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   search(:node, 'role:web',
     :filter_result => { 'name' => [ 'name' ],
                         'ip' => [ 'ipaddress' ],
                         'kernel_version' => [ 'kernel', 'version' ]
                       }
         ).each do |result|
     puts result['name']
     puts result['ip']
     puts result['kernel_version']
   end
