Use the ``with_run_context`` method to define a block that has a pointer to a location in the ``run_context`` hierarchy. Resources in recipes always run at the root of the ``run_context`` hierarchy, whereas custom resources and notification blocks always build a child ``run_context`` which contains their sub-resources.

The syntax for the ``with_run_context`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   with_run_context :type do
     # some arbitrary pure Ruby stuff goes here
   end

where ``:type`` may be one of the following:

* ``:root`` runs the block as part of the root ``run_context`` hierarchy
* ``:parent`` runs the block as part of the parent process in the ``run_context`` hierarchy

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   action :run do
     with_run_context :root do
       edit_resource(:my_thing, "accumulated state") do
         action :nothing
         my_array_property << accumulate_some_stuff
       end
     end
     log "kick it off" do
       notifies :run, "my_thing[accumulated state], :delayed
     end
   end
