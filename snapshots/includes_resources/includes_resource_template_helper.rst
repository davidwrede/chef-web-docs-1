A helper is a method or a module that can be used to extend a template. There are three approaches:

* An inline helper method
* An inline helper module
* A cookbook library module

Use the ``helper`` attribute in a recipe to define an inline helper method. Use the ``helpers`` attribute to define an inline helper module or a cookbook library module.
