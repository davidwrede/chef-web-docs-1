A **dsc_resource** resource block allows DSC resourcs to be used in a Chef recipe. For example, the DSC ``Archive`` resource:

.. code-block:: powershell

   Archive ExampleArchive {
     Ensure = "Present"
     Path = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\example.zip"
     Destination = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\ExtractionPath"
   } 

and then the same **dsc_resource** with Chef:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_resource 'example' do
      resource :archive
      property :ensure, 'Present'
      property :path, "C:\Users\Public\Documents\example.zip"
      property :destination, "C:\Users\Public\Documents\ExtractionPath"
    end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **dsc_resource** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_resource 'name' do
     module_name                String
     notifies                   # see description
     property                   Symbol
     resource                   String
     subscribes                 # see description
   end

where 

* ``dsc_resource`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``property`` is zero (or more) properties in the DSC resource, where each property is entered on a separate line, ``:dsc_property_name`` is the case-insensitive name of that property, and ``"property_value"`` is a Ruby value to be applied by the chef-client
* ``module_name``, ``property``, and ``resource`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.
