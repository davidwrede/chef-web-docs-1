.. The contents of this file may be included in multiple topics (using the includes directive).
.. The contents of this file should be modified in a way that preserves its ability to appear in multiple topics.

This resource has the following properties:

``atomic_update``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Perform atomic file updates on a per-resource basis. Set to ``true`` for atomic file updates. Set to ``false`` for non-atomic file updates. This setting overrides ``file_atomic_update``, which is a global setting found in the client.rb file. Default value: ``true``.

``backup``
   **Ruby Types:** FalseClass, Integer

   The number of backups to be kept in ``/var/chef/backup`` (for UNIX- and Linux-based platforms) or ``C:/chef/backup`` (for the Microsoft Windows platform). Set to ``false`` to prevent backups from being kept. Default value: ``5``.

``checksum``
   **Ruby Types:** String

   The SHA-256 checksum of the file. Use to ensure that a specific file is used. If the checksum does not match, the file is not used. Default value: no checksum required.

``content``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A string that is written to the file. The contents of this property replace any previous content when this property has something other than the default value. The default behavior will not modify content.

``force_unlink``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   How the chef-client handles certain situations when the target file turns out not to be a file. For example, when a target file is actually a symlink. Set to ``true`` for the chef-client delete the non-file target and replace it with the specified file. Set to ``false`` for the chef-client to raise an error. Default value: ``false``.

``group``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   A string or ID that identifies the group owner by group name, including fully qualified group names such as ``domain\group`` or ``group@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing groups remain unchanged and new group assignments use the default ``POSIX`` group (if available).

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``inherits``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Microsoft Windows only. Whether a file inherits rights from its parent directory. Default value: ``true``.

``manage_symlink_source``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass, NilClass

   Cause the chef-client to detect and manage the source file for a symlink. Possible values: ``nil``, ``true``, or ``false``. When this value is set to ``nil``, the chef-client will manage a symlink's source file and emit a warning. When this value is set to ``true``, the chef-client will manage a symlink's source file and not emit a warning. Default value: ``nil``. The default value will be changed to ``false`` in a future version.

``mode``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'`` and then applies the umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
       
   The behavior is different depending on the platform.
       
   UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it works exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``'0777'`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``01777`` or ``'1777'``.
       
   Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft Windows as they do in UNIX, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. include:: ../../includes_resources_common/includes_resources_common_notification_notifies.rst

   .. include:: ../../includes_resources_common/includes_resources_common_notification_timers_12-5.rst

   .. include:: ../../includes_resources_common/includes_resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax.rst

``owner``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   A string or ID that identifies the group owner by user name, including fully qualified user names such as ``domain\user`` or ``user@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing owners remain unchanged and new owner assignments use the current user (when necessary).	

``path``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The full path to the file, including the file name and its extension. For example: ``/files/file.txt``. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.

   Microsoft Windows: A path that begins with a forward slash (``/``) will point to the root of the current working directory of the chef-client process. This path can vary from system to system. Therefore, using a path that begins with a forward slash (``/``) is not recommended.

``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``rights``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   Microsoft Windows only. The permissions for users and groups in a Microsoft Windows environment. For example: ``rights <permissions>, <principal>, <options>`` where ``<permissions>`` specifies the rights granted to the principal, ``<principal>`` is the group or user name, and ``<options>`` is a Hash with one (or more) advanced rights options.

``sensitive``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Ensure that sensitive resource data is not logged by the chef-client. Default value: ``false``.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'
