The ``timestamped_deploy`` provider is the default **deploy** provider. It is used to name release directories with a timestamp in the form of ``YYYYMMDDHHMMSS``. For example: ``/my/deploy/dir/releases/20121120162342``. The **deploy** resource will determine whether or not to deploy code based on the existence of the release directory in which it is attempting to deploy. Because the timestamp is different for every chef-client run, the ``timestamped_deploy`` provider is not idempotent. When the ``timestamped_deploy`` provider is used, it requires that the action setting on a resource be managed manually in order to prevent unintended continuous deployment.
