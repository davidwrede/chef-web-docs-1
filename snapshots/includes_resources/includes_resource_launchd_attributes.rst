.. The contents of this file should be modified in a way that preserves its ability to appear in multiple topics.

This resource has the following properties:

``backup``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, FalseClass

   The number of backups to be kept in ``/var/chef/backup``. Set to ``false`` to prevent backups from being kept.

``cookbook``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the cookbook in which the source files are located.

``group``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Integer

   When launchd is run as the root user, the group to run the job as. If the ``username`` property is specified and this property is not, this value is set to the default group for the user.

``hash``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A Hash of key value pairs used to create the launchd property list.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``label``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The unique identifier for the job.

``mode``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If ``mode`` is not specified and if the directory already exists, the existing mode on the directory is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the directory does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'``, and then applies the umask for the system on which the directory is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
       
   The behavior is different depending on the platform.
       
   UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it works exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``'0777'`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``01777`` or ``'1777'``.
       
   Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft Windows as they do in UNIX, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.

   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String
