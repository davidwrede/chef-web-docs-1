This resource has the following properties:
   
``cookbook``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The cookbook in which a file is located (if it is not located in the current cookbook). The default value is the current cookbook.
   
``files_backup``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, FalseClass

   The number of backup copies to keep for files in the directory. Default value: ``5``.
   
``files_group``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Configure group permissions for files. A string or ID that identifies the group owner by group name, including fully qualified group names such as ``domain\group`` or ``group@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing groups remain unchanged and new group assignments use the default ``POSIX`` group (if available).
   
``files_mode``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The octal mode for a file.
       
   UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it works exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``'0777'`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``01777`` or ``'1777'``.
       
   Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft Windows as they do in UNIX, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.
   
``files_owner``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Configure owner permissions for files. A string or ID that identifies the group owner by user name, including fully qualified user names such as ``domain\user`` or ``user@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing owners remain unchanged and new owner assignments use the current user (when necessary).
   
``group``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   Use to configure permissions for directories. A string or ID that identifies the group owner by group name, including fully qualified group names such as ``domain\group`` or ``group@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing groups remain unchanged and new group assignments use the default ``POSIX`` group (if available).
   
``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.
   
``inherits``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Microsoft Windows only. Whether a file inherits rights from its parent directory. Default value: ``true``.
   
``mode``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If ``mode`` is not specified and if the directory already exists, the existing mode on the directory is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the directory does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'``, and then applies the umask for the system on which the directory is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
       
   The behavior is different depending on the platform.
       
   UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it works exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``'0777'`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``01777`` or ``'1777'``.
       
   Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft Windows as they do in UNIX, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.
   
``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

``overwrite``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Overwrite a file when it is different. Default value: ``true``.
   
``owner``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   Use to configure permissions for directories. A string or ID that identifies the group owner by user name, including fully qualified user names such as ``domain\user`` or ``user@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing owners remain unchanged and new owner assignments use the current user (when necessary).
   
``path``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to the directory. Using a fully qualified path is recommended, but is not always required. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.
   
``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.
   
``purge``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Purge extra files found in the target directory. Default value: ``false``.
   
``recursive``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Create or delete directories recursively. Default value: ``true``; the chef-client must be able to create the directory structure, including parent directories (if missing), as defined in ``COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default/REMOTE_DIRECTORY``.
   
``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.
   
``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.
   
``rights``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   Microsoft Windows only. The permissions for users and groups in a Microsoft Windows environment. For example: ``rights <permissions>, <principal>, <options>`` where ``<permissions>`` specifies the rights granted to the principal, ``<principal>`` is the group or user name, and ``<options>`` is a Hash with one (or more) advanced rights options.
   
``source``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The base name of the source file (and inferred from the ``path`` property).
