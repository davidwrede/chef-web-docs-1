This resource has the following properties:
   
``group``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   A string or ID that identifies the group associated with a symbolic link.
   
``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.
   
``link_type``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   The type of link: ``:symbolic`` or ``:hard``. Default value: ``:symbolic``.
   
``mode``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'`` and then applies the umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``. Default value: ``777``.
       
   The behavior is different depending on the platform.
       
   UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it works exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``'0777'`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``01777`` or ``'1777'``.
       
   Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft Windows as they do in UNIX, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.

``owner``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, String

   The owner associated with a symbolic link.
   
``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.
   
``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.
   
``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``target_file``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the link. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.
   
``to``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The actual file to which the link is to be created.
