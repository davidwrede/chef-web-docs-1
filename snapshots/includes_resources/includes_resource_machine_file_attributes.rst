.. The contents of this file may be included in multiple topics (using the includes directive).
.. The contents of this file should be modified in a way that preserves its ability to appear in multiple topics.

This resource has the following properties:
   
``chef_server``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   The URL for the Chef server.
   
``content``
   A string that is written to the file. The contents of this property replace any previous content when this property has something other than the default value. The default behavior will not modify content.
   
``driver``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef::Provisioning::Driver

   Use to specify the driver to be used for provisioning.
   
``group``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A string or ID that identifies the group owner by group name, including fully qualified group names such as ``domain\group`` or ``group@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing groups remain unchanged and new group assignments use the default ``POSIX`` group (if available).
   
``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.
   
``local_path``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The local path to a file.
   
``machine``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Use to specify the machine type.
   
``mode``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'`` and then applies the umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
       
   The behavior is different depending on the platform.
       
   UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it works exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``'0777'`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``01777`` or ``'1777'``.
       
   Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft Windows as they do in UNIX, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

``owner``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A string or ID that identifies the group owner by user name, including fully qualified user names such as ``domain\user`` or ``user@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing owners remain unchanged and new owner assignments use the current user (when necessary).
   
``path``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The full path to the file, including the file name and its extension. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.

   Microsoft Windows: A path that begins with a forward slash (``/``) will point to the root of the current working directory of the chef-client process. This path can vary from system to system. Therefore, using a path that begins with a forward slash (``/``) is not recommended.
   
``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.
   
``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.
   
``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'
