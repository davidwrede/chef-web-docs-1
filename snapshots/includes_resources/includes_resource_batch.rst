Use the **batch** resource to execute a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter. The **batch** resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. This resource inherits actions (``:run`` and ``:nothing``) and properties (``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``group``, ``path``, ``timeout``, and ``user``) from the **execute** resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.
