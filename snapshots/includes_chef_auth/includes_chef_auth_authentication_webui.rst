The Chef server user interface uses the Chef server API to perform most operations. This ensures that authentication requests to the Chef server are authorized. This authentication process is handled automatically and is not something that users of the hosted Chef server will need to manage. For the on-premises Chef server, the authentication keys used by the web interface will need to be maintained by the individual administrators who are responsible for managing the server.
