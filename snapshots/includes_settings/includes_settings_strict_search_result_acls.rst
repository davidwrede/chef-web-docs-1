Use to specify that search results only return objects to which an actor (user, client, etc.) has read access, as determined by ACL settings. This affects all searches. When ``true``, the performance of the Chef management console may increase because it enables the Chef management console to skip redundant ACL checks. To ensure the Chef management console is configured properly, after this setting has been applied with a ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` run ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure`` to ensure the Chef management console also picks up the setting. Default value: ``false``.

.. warning:: When ``true``, ``opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']`` affects all search results and any actor (user, client, etc.) that does not have read access to a search result will not be able to view it. For example, this could affect search results returned during chef-client runs if a chef-client does not have permission to read the information.
