The chef-repo is the location in which the following data objects are stored: 

* Cookbooks (including recipes, versions, cookbook attributes, resources, providers, libraries, and templates)
* Roles
* Data bags
* Environments
* Configuration files (for clients, workstations, and servers) 

The chef-repo is located on a workstation and should be synchronized with a version control system, such as git. All of the data in the chef-repo should be treated like source code. 

knife is used to upload data to the Chef server from the chef-repo. Once uploaded, that data is used by the chef-client to manage all of the nodes that are registered with the Chef server and to ensure that the correct cookbooks, environments, roles, and other settings are applied to nodes correctly.
