There are two ways to create a chef-repo when using the Chef boilerplate repository as a base:

* Clone the chef-repo from GitHub
* Download the chef-repo as a tar.gz file and place it into local version source control.

.. note:: Chef strongly recommends using some type of version control tool to manage the source code in the chef-repo. Chef uses git for everything, including for cookbooks. git and/or GitHub is not required to use Chef. If another version source control system is preferred over git (such as Subversion, Mercurial, or Bazaar) that is just fine.
