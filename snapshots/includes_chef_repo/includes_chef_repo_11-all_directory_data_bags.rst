The ``data_bags/`` directory is used to store all of the data bags that exist for an organization. Each sub-directory corresponds to a single data bag on the Chef server and contains a JSON file for each data bag item. If a sub-directory does not exist, then create it using SSL commands. After a data bag item is created, it can then be uploaded to the Chef server.
