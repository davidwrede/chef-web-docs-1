Invoke the library helper in a recipe:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Chef.event_handler do
     on :run_failed do
       HandlerSendEmail::Helper.new.send_email_on_run_failure(
         Chef.run_context.node.name
       )
     end
   end

* Use ``Chef.event_handler`` to define the event handler
* Use the ``on`` method to specify the event type

Within the ``on`` block, tell the chef-client how to handle the event when it's triggered.
