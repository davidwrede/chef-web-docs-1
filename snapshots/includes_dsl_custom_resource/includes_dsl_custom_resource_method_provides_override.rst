Chef will warn you if the Recipe DSL is provided by another custom resource or built-in resource. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class X < Chef::Resource
     provides :file
   end

   class Y < Chef::Resource
     provides :file
   end

This will emit a warning that ``Y`` is overriding ``X``. To disable this warning, use ``override: true``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class X < Chef::Resource
     provides :file
   end

   class Y < Chef::Resource
     provides :file, override: true
   end
