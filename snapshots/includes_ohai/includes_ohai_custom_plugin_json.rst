Ohai saves data as JSON. For example, the following provider:

.. code-block:: ruby

   provides 'sl'
   
   if File.exist?('/usr/games/sl')
     sl Mash.new
     sl[:installed] = true
   end

would result in data being stored in a file as JSON data, similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     'sl': {
       'installed': true
     }
   }

This is the data that is collected by Ohai and the data that is added to the node object that is generated by every chef-client run.

Barewords are added to the JSON data, and are then added to the node object. For example, the following bare ``sl`` creates an empty mash:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if File.exist?('/usr/games/sl')
     sl Mash.new
     sl[:installed] = true
   end 

into which key/value pairs (``sl[:installed] = true``) are added.
