This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: xml

   GET /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/node_states/NODE_NAME

The response is similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "node_name": "FIONA", 
     "status": "down", 
     "updated_at": "Tue, 04 Sep 2012 23:17:56 GMT"
   }

where ``updated_at`` shows the date and time at which a node's status last changed.
