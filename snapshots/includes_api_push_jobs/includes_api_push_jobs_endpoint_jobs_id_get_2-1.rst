The ``GET`` method is used to get the status of an individual job, including node state (running, complete, crashed).

This method accepts one optional query parameter: ``?include_file``. If set to ``true``,
then the ``file_specified`` attributed will be omitted from ``GET`` requests and the ``file``
attribute will be included with the contents of the file prefixed with ``raw:`` or ``base64:``.

where:

* ``command`` is the command that is being run.
* ``run_timeout`` is the number of seconds to wait for the run to complete.
* ``status`` is one of the following: ``aborted`` (the job was aborted), ``complete`` (the job completed; see ``nodes`` for individual node status), ``quorum_failed`` (the command was not run on any nodes), ``running`` (the command is running), ``timed_out`` (the command timed out), and ``voting`` (waiting for nodes; quorum not yet met).
* ``created_at`` is the date and time at which the job started running
* ``updated_at`` is the date and time at which the job entered its present ``status``
* ``nodes`` is one of the following: ``aborted`` (node ran command, stopped before completion), ``complete`` (node ran command to completion), ``crashed`` (node went down after command started running), ``nacked`` (node was busy), ``new`` (node has not accepted or rejected command), ``ready`` (node has accepted command, command has not started running), ``running`` (node has accepted command, command is running), and ``unavailable`` (node went down before command started).
* ``user`` is the user you wish to run the job as on the node.
* ``dir`` is the directory you wish to run the job from on the node.
* ``file_specified`` is a boolean indicated whether or not a file was passed in when the job was created.
* ``capture_output`` is a boolean indicating whether the STDOUT and STDERR is being capture for this job. If this value is false, it is omitted from the output.
