This endpoint opens a Server-Sent-Events (SSE) feed with the Push Jobs server.

This method has no parameters.

The Accept header for this request must be ``application/event-stream``.

As specified in the SSE protocol, you may request all events since a particular ID by including the optional ``Last-Event-ID`` Header.
If the ID is omitted, or not recognized, the stream will start from the beginning of the job.

**Completed Jobs**

In the job feed, for a brief period after a job completes, the event stream will remain available. The request will behave as normal,
which means the client will see the stream of events from the beginning of the job (or if specified, the ``Last-Event-ID``), through to
the job completion, and then the connection will be immediately closed by the server. The amount of time before it completes is configurable,
but defaults to 5 seconds.

If a request is made for the feed after the waiting period, then the request will result in a single event, a "summary" event, which contains
the same data as requesting a named-job resource. In this case, any ``Last-Event-ID`` will be ignored.
