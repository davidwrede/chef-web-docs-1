The Chef server gathers a lot of data. For example:

* Changes made to each node object
* The run history for all nodes
* The history of every cookbook (and cookbook version)
* How and where policy settings---roles, environments, and data bags---are applied
* Which users made which changes

The Chef Analytics server collects all of this data and makes it visible from the Chef Analytics user interface.
