Starting with the release of Chef server 11, the front-end for the Chef server is written using `Erlang <http://www.erlang.org/>`_, which is a programming language that `first appeared in 1986 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29>`_, was open sourced in 1998, and is excellent with critical enterprise concerns like concurrency, fault-tolerance, and distributed environments.
