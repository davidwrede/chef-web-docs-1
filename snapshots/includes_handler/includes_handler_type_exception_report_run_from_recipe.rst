The **chef_handler** resource allows exception and report handlers to be enabled from within recipes, which can then added to the run-list for any node on which the exception or report handler should run. The **chef_handler** resource is available from the **chef_handler** cookbook.

To use the **chef_handler** resource in a recipe, add code similar to the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_handler 'name_of_handler' do
     source '/path/to/handler/handler_name'
     action :enable
   end

For example, a handler for Growl needs to be enabled at the beginning of the chef-client run:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_gem 'chef-handler-growl'

and then is activated in a recipe by using the **chef_handler** resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_handler 'Chef::Handler::Growl' do
     source 'chef/handler/growl'
     action :enable
   end
