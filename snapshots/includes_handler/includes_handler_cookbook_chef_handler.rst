Exception and report handlers can be distributed using the **chef_handler** cookbook. This cookbook is authored and maintained by Chef and exposes a custom resource that can be used to enable custom handlers from within recipes and to include product-specific handlers from cookbooks. The **chef_handler** cookbook can be accessed here: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef_handler. See the ``README.md`` for additional information.
