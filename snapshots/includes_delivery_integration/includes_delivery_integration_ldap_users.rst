Integrating Chef Automate with your LDAP system allows you to automatically add more user details and authenticate users against your existing identity management system. However, even once your LDAP system has been integrated to Chef Automate, you must manually add users. If you are going to add a user in your integrated LDAP system to Chef Automate, you must have their LDAP name.
