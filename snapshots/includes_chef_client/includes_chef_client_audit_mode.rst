The chef-client may be run in audit-mode. Use audit-mode to evaluate custom rules---also referred to as audits---that are defined in recipes. audit-mode may be run in the following ways:

* By itself (i.e. a chef-client run that does not build the resource collection or converge the node)
* As part of the chef-client run, where audit-mode runs after all resources have been converged on the node

Each audit is authored within a recipe using the ``control_group`` and ``control`` methods that are part of the Recipe DSL. Recipes that contain audits are added to the run-list, after which they can be processed by the chef-client. Output will appear in the same location as the regular chef-client run (as specified by the ``log_location`` setting in the client.rb file).

Finished audits are reported back to the Chef server. From there, audits are sent to the Chef Analytics platform for further analysis, such as rules processing and visibility from the actions web user interface.
