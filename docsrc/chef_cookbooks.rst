Chef Maintained Cookbooks
=====================================================

A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. Each cookbook defines a scenario, and includes some (or all) of the following:

* Attribute values that are set on nodes
* Definitions that allow the creation of reusable collections of resources
* File distributions
* Libraries that extend the chef-client and/or provide helpers to Ruby code
* Recipes that specify which resources to manage and the order in which those resources will be applied
* Custom resources and providers
* Templates
* Metadata about recipes (including dependencies), version constraints, supported platforms, and so on
